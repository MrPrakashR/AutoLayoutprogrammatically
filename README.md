# AutoLayoutprogrammatically

Auto Layout programmatically :

1. translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints :  
    * For programmatically created view default value is true and views from interface builder is false.
    * If this property set too True, the system automatically creates a set of constraints based on view’s frame and its autoresizing mask.
    * If you add your own constraint on top of this, they inevitably Conflict with the autogenerated constraints. 
    * Error : [LayoutConstraints] Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints. (Error will get for conflict)
    * This creates an unsatisfiable layout. So When programmatically instantiating views.
    *  Be sure to set their translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints property to NO.
2. Layout Anchors :

Auto Layout constraints : 
    * Constraints are set off rule to make os know where to place UI Components. introduced in iOS6 and iPadOS6.
    * There are two ways to set constraint UI Builder and programmatically. 
* First Step: 
	let view = UIView(frame: .zero)
	view.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
*  Second Step: There are two ways to set constraint programmatically i.e Anchors or Visual Format Language (or VFL). 
* Eg : 
    * Anchors Language.
	  view.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant:100)
	  view.widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant:100)
    *  VFL
	  let viewDictionary = [“view”: view]
	  let horizontalConstraint = NSLayoutConstraint.constraints(withVisualFormat: 	 “H: [view(100)]”, metrics: nil, views: viewDictionary)
	  let verticalConstraint = NSLayoutConstaint.constaints(withVisualFormat:”V: 	  [view(100)]”,metrics:nil, views:viewDictionary)
	
Layouts : 

locationButton.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalToSystemSpacingAfter: view.leadingAnchor, multiplier: 1)

1. The way to read this line of code is this:
    * “I would like the location button’s leading anchor to be equal to the system spacing (8 pts) after the view’s leading anchor”.
2 . Apple uses a standard margin spacing of 8 pts. Previously we had been setting it manually. But by using this API we don’t have to. We just have to set its multiplier instead.
    * 1 = 8 pts.
    * 2 = 16 pts
    * 3 = 24 pts and so on.
3. This is is functionally equivalent to:
    * locationButton.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor, constant: 8)
    * if Apple were ever to change the value of their standard spacing, we would adjust automatically.

  
view.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalToSystemSpacingAfter: searchButton.trailingAnchor, multiplier: 1)

1. We would like the views trailing anchor to be equal to the system spacing after the search button with a multiplier of 
2. This is is functionally equivalent to:
   * searchButton.rightAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.rightAnchor,constant: -8),
